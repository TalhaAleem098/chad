            Based in Sydney, Australia, I am a professional Actor, Model,
            Presenter, and Content Creator with over 20 years of experience
            across the international entertainment industry. My career has taken
            me from film and television sets to photo studios, live stages,
            radio stations, and digital platforms—each offering new
            opportunities to perform, connect, and create.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-base lg:text-lg leading-7  ">
            Over the years, I have worked extensively across film, television,
            modelling, and presenting for both stage and screen, including radio
            and community television. Alongside numerous commercial campaigns
            within Australia and abroad, I&apos;ve been fortunate to collaborate with
            exceptional creative teams and production companies around the
            world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-base lg:text-lg leading-7  ">
            I have commercially represented some of the world&apos;s most recognised
            brands—including Qantas, Jetstar, BMW, RSPCA, Cancer Council, Car
            Australia, DiDi, ING, Chemist Warehouse, Luxaflex, OzCar, and many
            more—both online and on air.

            My passion for performance began early, singing in my school choir
            and taking part in yearly stage productions. That early love of
            storytelling evolved into a lifelong pursuit of the craft. To refine
            my skills, I&apos;ve studied at some of the most respected acting schools
            and institutions both locally and internationally, including
            National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), Australian Film and
            Television Academy (TAFTA), The Actors Centre (Sydney), Victorian
            College of the Arts (VCA), Sydney Drama School, Rogues West Acting
            School (Vancouver, Canada), and Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA,
            London).

          <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-base lg:text-lg leading-7 ">
            Throughout my career, I&apos;ve had the privilege of working with many
            talented directors, producers, ADs, photographers, videographers,
            and production crews across the globe. I&apos;ve appeared in a wide range
            of film and television productions and have commercially represented
            some of the world&apos;s most recognised brands.

          <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-base lg:text-lg leading-7 ">
            Acting has always been at the heart of what I do. I&apos;ve had the
            opportunity to play lead, featured, supporting, and character roles
            across both film and television, with screen credits including
            Cleverman, Crownies, Behind Mansion Walls, Deadly Women, The Wedge,
            Satisfaction, and The Librarians.

            I have also enjoyed a strong career in live television
            presenting—appearing on OpenShop, TV Shop, and hosting community
            programs and radio shows for Outlook TV, Out TV, Bent TV, and JOY
            96.9FM, celebrating diverse voices within the LGBTQIA+ community.

            In recent years, I have embraced the creative potential of digital
            platforms and social media. Working directly with clients online has
            opened new doors for collaboration, storytelling, and brand
            partnerships, allowing me to merge my industry experience with
            modern content creation.

            Home: Health, fitness, and wellness are core parts of who I am, both
            personally and professionally. I believe in maintaining a healthy
            lifestyle and positive mindset, and I&apos;ve had the pleasure of working
            on campaigns that promote wellbeing, adventure, and
            self-improvement. My sense of self and adventure has taken me all
            around the world and back again—and what an incredible journey it&apos;s
            been. I&apos;m Australian born, Australian proud, and more motivated than
            ever to keep creating, collaborating, and moving forward.
